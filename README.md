# Manifold-Learning

- Implemented spectral clustering and evaluated on a dataset of concentric circles.
- Implemented Multi-Dimensional Scaling, Locally Linear Embedding function, Isomap Visualization and evaluated on a S shaped dataset.
- Performed K-Means and spectral clustering on the Swiss roll dataset and visualized using MDS, LLE and Isomap Vizulisation.
- Performed classification using SVM on CIFAR-10 dataset by reducing dimensions using PCA and ISOMAP.
